class HLibrary(object):
    """ Describes a hieratika parameter library.
        An HLibrary is a collection of values that can be assigned to different variables. 
        A typical example is a waveform definition.
        The same waveform definition (i.e. the actual values) might be used by many parameters. As a consequence these parameters need only to link (refer)
        to this waveform definition (by name) in order to be configured (as opposed to be individually configured with the same values).
        Note that this is not the place where to define structured types. The same structured type might be used by many libraries. As an example, 
        a waveform structured type might be used by a library for selecting power supply references and by a library for selecting data acquisition time windows.
        This means that when linking variables from the power supply, only the waveforms which are associated to the power supply references are going to be avaiable for 
        user selection (even if any other waveforms would be type compatible). The main reasoning is that expert users will pre-cook waveforms whose content/value is meaningful
        for the given use-case (power supply references in this example).

        A library which is locked cannot be modified nor deleted from the system. This is to avoid that a given library definition is used in a given configuration and is later overriden.
